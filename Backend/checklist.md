# Test Issues Checklist

## Jest Configuration Issues
- [ ] Fix Jest ESM/async await support
  - Issue: SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functions and the top level bodies of modules
  - Solution: Update setup.js to use proper async structure

## Test Scoring Algorithm Test Coverage
- [ ] Implement unit tests for test scoring algorithm
  - Test calculateScore method for all scoring types (simple, weighted, adaptive, custom)
  - Test normalization methods (z-score, percentile, custom)
  - Test edge cases and error handling
  - Test configuration validation
  - Test middleware functionality
  - Test statistics calculations

- [ ] Add integration tests for scoring algorithm
  - Test interaction with PersonalityTrait model
  - Test real-world scoring scenarios
  - Test performance with large datasets

## Mongoose Deprecation Warnings
- [ ] Remove deprecated MongoDB connection options
  - Issue: useNewUrlParser and useUnifiedTopology are deprecated
  - Solution: Remove these options as they're no longer needed in MongoDB Driver 4.0+

## Model Issues
### Personality Trait Model
- [ ] Fix validateScore function implementation
  - Issue: trait.validateScore is not a function
  - Solution: Implement validateScore method in personality-trait.model.js

  - Solution: Add metadata schema with version field

- [ ] Fix measurement scale validation
  - Issue: Scale validation not working as expected
  - Solution: Implement proper validation for measurement scale min/max values

## Integration Test Issues
- [ ] Fix server initialization in tests
  - Issue: app.address is not a function & EADDRINUSE errors
  - Solution: Properly export app without starting server, use supertest properly

## Model Registration Issues
- [ ] Fix duplicate model registration
  - Issue: OverwriteModelError: Cannot overwrite 'TestScoringAlgorithm' model
  - Solution: Implement proper model registration prevention

## Warning Issues
- [ ] Fix mongoose validate method warning
  - Issue: Warning about overwriting internal mongoose validate method
  - Solution: Use suppressWarning option or rename custom validate methods

## Duplicate Index Warnings
